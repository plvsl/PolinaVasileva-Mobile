1.	Add support of appPackage and appActivity parameters for Android devices (reading from a .properties file and then
setting in the DesiredCapabilities). Locally installed Appium DT doesn’t need these parameters, but for Appium server
of Mobile Farm (Minsk, SPb) it’s mandatory.

2.	Change settings to run web test on a certain iOS device on Mobile Test Farm. Run test with your changes.
Did test pass?

It hasn't passed because of one(last) assert but i don't have ability to debug it.

3.	Change settings to run native test on a certain/random Android device on Mobile Test Farm.
 Run test with your changes. Did test pass?

Yes, test passed.

4.	What’s wrong with our code? How to fix/improve it? Implement your suggestions.

Firstly, it was hard to read it because we didn't use page objects, so I fixed that.

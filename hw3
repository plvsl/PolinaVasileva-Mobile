1.	Rewrite (complete) Driver using “singleton” pattern. Are there any advantages?

There is an advantage of singletone - it allows you to get an existing instance of an object in any place if it is defined or
define a new one if it is null for some reason.

2.	Suggest improvements for .properties reading. What are the purposes?

I separated properties for native and web applications and implemented logic which helps test framework
to choose by itself what .property file it should use depending on test.

3.	Add checks of other fields and their titles (Contact Name, Contact phone) in “native” test

4.	Optional: Add keyboard presence check  in “native” test.

I replaced initialisation of AppiumDriver with platform dependent drivers(IOSDriver and AndroidDriver) and
implemented some logic for helping test framework to chose by itself what driver do we need.

5.	Which checks would you place in the “web” test?

I placed few checks for main page's div blocks, "Google search" textbox and button as a proof of concept.

6.	Implement checks for “web” test in code and try to use.
